abstract = {Abstract Nanotechnology has the potential to transform EOR mechanisms and processes. At present there are two major nanotechnology paradigms derived from mechanical engineering and the biological sciences perspectives. However, a new focus within nanotechnology is emerging which could be called geomimetics. We can define geomimetics as employing the principles of geosystems to create and develop new and novel processes and materials. In a wider sense this involves copying the principles of geosystems into technology to compliment the natural environment. This geomimetic perspective of nanotechnology incorporates the long and distinguished history of colloid and surface science that has underpinned oil recovery and EOR. We give a concise definition of nanotechnology and demonstrate how it is applicable to EOR. Through consideration of complexity and systems thinking, we develop a process based method of representing complicated phenomena to help identify the critical processes which control EOR. We construct a hierarchy from fundamental surface forces leading up to processes such as coalescence, phase swelling and film drainage. This hierarchy constitutes a mapping from fundamental molecular forces onto petroleum engineering concepts. In general this hierarchy is spatially-temporally ordered, although particular attention to the overall context and fluid / rock history is needed when mapping wetting and spreading phenomena. We identify critical processes and identify p},

abstract = {Abstract Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already screened for EOR processes, the main challenges such as low sweep efficiency, costly techniques, possible formation damages, transportation of huge amounts of EOR agents to the fields especially for offshore cases, analyzing micro-scale multi-phase flow in the rock to the large scale tests and the lack of analyzing tools in traditional experimental works, hinder the proposed EOR processes. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes, revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with old EOR techniques. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to release the trapped oil from the pore spaces in the order of 5 to 50 microns of tight oil formations. Laboratory tests using nanoparticles as the EOR agent, developing nano computational models to explore the surface properties and utilizing nano-scale analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mostly for nanoparticles distribution in the pore spaces and on the surfaces for wettability alteration studies are the main parts of this investigation},

abstract = {Molecular models of three amino-functionalized cubic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) have been studied at 293K using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These hybrid organic/inorganic systems were all based on the T8R8 form, but they differed by the end-groups of their organic pendant chains, i.e. either R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H5OH, R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H6 or R=–(CH2)3–NH–CO–C6H11. Model densities, volumes, cohesive energies, void spaces, X-ray diffractograms and intermolecular as well as intramolecular interactions were analysed. The differences in bulk and structural properties between both aromatic-based organic chains are fairly small, although the added hydroxyl groups bring additional cohesion by modifying the amide⋯amide H-bonding network. On the other hand, replacing an aromatic by a cyclohexyl ring leads to molecular disorder, larger POSS⋯POSS separations and a lower density. The pendant arms of the three POSS under study were found to be intertwined with a preference for intermolecular interactions because of steric considerations. Such an interdigitation also allowed for the parallel stacking of the ring end-groups at short distances, thus bringing extra cohesion to the systems. However, there was no evidence of long-range crystalline order.},

The kinetics parameters of the gelation reactions were determined using steady shear viscometry at temperatures of 80 to 130 °C. The addition of salts to the mixing water was found to increase the gelation time. On the other hand, higher polymer and cross-linker concentrations reduced the gelation time. The activation energy was found to be 118 kJ/mol in distilled water and decreased to 93 kJ/mol in seawater. The reaction orders were found to be first order with respect to both PAtBA and PEI. The effects of initial pH and contamination with iron(III) on the gelation time were also examined in detail. Recommendations for field application of this gelling system are given.},

@article{Idahosa2016,
abstract = {Laboratory core flood experiments were conducted at different flow rates with partially hydrolysed polyacrylamide (HPAM) oilfield Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) polymer and silica sand to investigate the polymer retention in porous media due to flow rate variation. Specifically, the double-polymer bank method was used in a new way to quantify and understand total incremental retention (both reversible and irreversible) induced by flow rate variation for HPAM polymers. Experimental results indicate that adsorption was the dominant retention mechanism. Further, the results obtained show that polymer adsorption was rate-dependent (i.e., as flow rate increased, adsorption increased), and that the adsorption was largely reversible with minimal incremental irreversible adsorption. It was also observed that flow rate impacted polymer inaccessible pore volume (IAPV) decreasing from 32{\%} to 15{\%} as flow rate increased from 0.8ml/min to 6.0ml/min. Finally, results from the study also give better insight into understanding HPAM flow-induced adsorption and their effect on permeability reduction processes.},

abstract = {The Baltic Sea comprises a heterogeneous oceanographic environment influencing the spatial and temporal potential for reproductive success of cod (Gadus morhua) and sprat (Sprattus sprattus) in the different spawning basins. Hence, to quantify stock and recruitment dynamics, it is necessary to resolve species-specific regional reproductive success in relation to size, structure, and distribution of the spawning stock. Furthermore, as species and fisheries interactions vary between areas, it is necessary to include these interactions on an area-specific basis. Therefore, area-disaggregated multispecies virtual population analyses (MSVPA) were performed for interacting species cod, herring (Clupea harengus), and sprat in the different subdivisions of the Central Baltic. The MSVPA runs revealed distinct spatial trends in population abundance, spawning biomass, recruitment, and predation-induced mortality. Results, when evaluated with respect to trends in population sizes from research surveys, were similar f...},

abstract = {Synthetic polymers are important in many branches of industry, for example in the packaging industry. However, they have an undesirable influence on the environment and cause problems with waste deposition and utilization. Thus, there is a tendency to substitute such polymers with polymers that undergo biodegradable processes. Increasing interest in applying polymers based on natural materials such as starch has been observed. This review describes biodegradation processes of xenobiotics such as aromatic compounds, plastics (PVA, polyesters, polyethylene, and nylon), and polymer blends (Starch/Polyethylene, Starch/Polyester, and Starch/PVA). Moreover, this review includes information about biodegradable polymers such as mixtures of synthetic polymers and substances that are easy digestible by microorganisms (chemically modified starch, starch-polymer composites, thermoplastic starch, and biodegradable packing materials), synthetic materials with groups susceptible to hydrolytic microbial attack (polycaprolactone), and biopolyesters (poly-$\beta$-hydroxyalkanoates). Production of this kind of material and introducing it to the market is important for the natural environmental. It may result in decreasing the volume of waste dumps.},

In this study, a partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide-hexamine-hydroquinonegel is used for the development of polymer gel system. The experimental investigation demonstrates that the gelation time varies with polymer and crosslinker concentration and the temperature. The mathematical model is developed with the help of gelation kinetics of polymer gel and using Arrhenius equation, which relates the gelation time with polymer, crosslinker concentrations, and temperature. The developed model is solved with the help of multivariate regression method. It is observed in this study that the theoretical values of gelation time have good agreement with the experimental values.},

abstract = {Suspensions of nanometre-sized particles (nanofluids) are used in a variety of technological contexts. For example, their spreading and adhesion behaviour on solid surfaces can yield materials with desirable structural and optical properties1. Similarly, the spreading behaviour of nanofluids containing surfactant micelles has implications for soil remediation, oily soil removal, lubrication and enhanced oil recovery. But the well-established concepts of spreading and adhesion of simple liquids do not apply to nanofluids2,3,4,5,6,7. Theoretical investigations have suggested that a solid-like ordering of suspended spheres will occur in the confined three-phase contact region at the edge of the spreading fluid, becoming more disordered and fluid-like towards the bulk phase8,9. Calculations have also suggested that the pressure arising from such colloidal ordering in the confined region will enhance the spreading behaviour of nanofluids10,11. Here we use video microscopy to demonstrate both the two-dimensional crystal-like ordering of charged nanometre-sized polystyrene spheres in water, and the enhanced spreading dynamics of a micellar fluid, at the three-phase contact region. Our findings suggest a new mechanism for oily soil removal—detergency.},

abstract = {The application of nanotechnology in the oil and gas industry is on the rise as evidenced by the number of researches undertaken in the past few years. The quest to develop more game-changing technologies that can address the challenges currently facing the industry has spurred this growth. Several nanoparticles, of different sizes and at different concentrations, have been used in many investigations. In this work, the scope of the study covered the application of nanotechnology in drilling and hydraulic fracturing fluids, oilwell cementing, enhanced oil recovery (which includes transport study, and foam and emulsion stability), corrosion inhibition, logging operations, formation fines control during production, heavy oil viscosity reduction, hydrocarbon detection, methane release from gas hydrates, and drag reduction in porous media. The observed challenges associated with the use of nanoparticles are their stability in a liquid medium and transportability in reservoir rocks. The addition of viscosifier was implemented by researchers to ensure stability, and also, surface-treated nanoparticles have been used to facilitate stability and transportability. For the purpose of achieving better performance or new application, studies on synergistic effects are suggested for investigation in future nanotechnology research. The resulting technology from the synergistic studies may reinforce the current and future nanotechnology applications in the oil and gas industry, especially for high pressure and high temperature (HPHT) applications. To date, majority of the oil and gas industry nanotechnology publications are reports of laboratory experimental work; therefore, more field trials are recommended for further advancement of nanotechnology in this industry. Usually, nanoparticles are expensive; so, it will be cost beneficial to use the lowest nanoparticles concentration possible while still achieving an acceptable level of a desired performance. Hence, optimization studies are also recommended for examination in future nanotechnology research.},

abstract = {Nanostructures for Novel Therapy: Synthesis, Characterization and Applications focuses on the fabrication and characterization of therapeutic nanostructures, in particular, synthesis, design, and in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluation. The chapters provide a cogent overview of recent therapeutic applications of nanostructured materials that includes applications of nanostructured materials for wound healing in plastic surgery and stem cell therapy. The book explores the promise for more effective therapy through the use of nanostructured materials, while also assessing the challenges their use might pose from both an economic and medicinal point of view. This innovative look at how nanostructured materials are used in therapeutics will be of great benefit to researchers, providing a greater understanding of the different ways nanomaterials could improve medical treatment, along with a discussion of the obstacles that need to be overcome in order to guarantee widespread availability. Outlines how the characteristics of nanostructures made from different materials gives particular properties that can be successfully used in therapeuticsCompares the properties of different nanostructures, allowing medicinal chemists and engineers to select which are most appropriate for their needsHighlights new uses of nanostructures within the therapeutic field, enabling the discovery of new, more effective drugs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Graphene oxide, nanographene oxide and partially reduced graphene oxide have been studied as possible foam stabilizing agents for CO2 based enhanced oil recovery. Graphene oxide was able to stabilize CO2/synthetic sea water foams, while nanographene oxide and partially reduced graphene oxide were not able to stabilize foams. The inability of nanographene oxide for stabilizing foams was explained by the increase of hydrophilicity due to size decrease, while for partially reduced graphene oxide, the high degree of reduction of the material was considered to be the reason. Graphene oxide brine dispersions showed immediate gel formation, which improved foam stability. Particle growth due to layer stacking was also observed. This mechanism was detrimental for foam stabilization. Gel formation and particle growth caused these particles to block pores and not being filterable. The work indicates that the particles studied are not suitable for CO2 enhanced oil recovery purposes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Manan2015,
abstract = {Enhancement of foam stability has been recently evidenced with addition of nanoparticles (NPs), especially in the case of CO2 foams. Stabilized foams via solid NPs can potentially withstand high reservoirs temperatures. Studies have been conducted to examine the effect of NPs on foam stability; however, more research is required for various types of NPs. Therefore, the authors aimed to investigate the performance of silicon dioxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), copper oxide (CuO), and titanium dioxide (TiO2) of different sizes in the presence of fixed concentration of anionic surfactant (AOS) on foam stability. Nano particle concentrations of (0.1 wt{\%}, 0.3 wt{\%}, 0.5 wt{\%}, and 1 wt{\%}) were used to investigate the foam stability, displacement test were performed to determine oil recovery at the optimum concentrations for each nanoparticle. The stability of the aqueous foam was evaluated by the Ross-Miles method using half-life measurements. All experiments were conducted at room temperature and pressure. The...},

abstract = {Nano-nickel catalyst was prepared in methylcyclohexane-water-n-octanol-AEO9 micro-emulsion system, and used in the viscosity reduction process of Liaohe extra-heavy oil by aqua-thermolysis. It is observed that the nano-nickel can catalyze the aqua-thermolysis reaction of extra-heavy oil at 280 °C. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the original crude oil sample, the mean molecular weight of the upgraded sample decreases, the content of sulfur changes from 0.45{\%} to 0.23{\%}, the content of resin and asphaltene reduces 15.83{\%} and 15.33{\%}, respectively. Based on the GC-MS analysis results, a reaction pathway is proposed that involves hydrogen transfer from methylcyclohexane to the extra-heavy crude oil resulting in the formation of toluene. During the cooling process after upgrading reaction, the W/O emulsion is formed in the presence of the surfactant AEO9. As a result, with respect to the original crude oil, the viscosity of upgraded sample is changed from 139800 mPa{\textperiodcentered}s to 2400 mPa{\textperiodcentered}s at 50 °C, an approximately 98.90{\%} reduction by the synergetic effects of upgrading, emulsification and diluting.},

Studies were conducted to demonstrate that the aquathermolytic chemical processes play a significant role in in-situ steam stimulation and that the results of such chemical processes can be important in the development and production of heavy oils and oil sands. Significant chemical reaction was shown to occur between oil sands and water (steam) in the temperature range of 200-300 degrees C. Thermal cracking was only significant above 300 degrees C. The primary sand reaction involved reactive mineral carbonates yielding varying amounts of CO{sub 2} which could affect the acidity of the system and the viscosity of the oil by dissolving in it. It was shown that aquathermolysis can effect the production of H{sub 2}S gas, viscosity of produced oil and maturation of the regions of the reservoir around the production zone. 35 refs., 5 tabs., 24 figs.},

abstract = {The role of nanoparticles in enhancing oil recovery from oil reservoirs is an increasingly important topic of research. Nanoparticles have the properties that are potentially useful for enhanced oil recovery processes, as they are solid and two orders of magnitude smaller than colloidal particles. This paper presents a comparison between the efficiency of modified silica nanoparticles in enhancing oil recovery from two different Iranian light and intermediate oil reservoirs. The mechanisms used to recover additional oil would be oil–water interfacial tension reduction and wettability alteration. Oil phase contact angles and oil–water interfacial tensions were measured in the absence and the presence of nano fluids' different concentrations (1–4g/L). Results showed that the interfacial tension reduces dramatically in the presence of nanoparticles for both light and intermediate oil. In addition oil phase contact angle results showed a transformation of rock wettability from water-wet toward oil-wet condition. However, these nanoparticles are more capable in the reduction of the interfacial tension and the alteration of wettability in the case of light oil reservoir. A comparison between recovery results indicated that these nanoparticles are more efficient in light oil reservoirs and produce more incremental amount of oil after primary and secondary processes.},

An adopted scale of reservoir wettabilities (water-, intermediate-, and oil-wet systems) is used for the core plugs, which were prepared by aging processes. The relationships among temperature, initial wettability, and an additional oil recovery nanofluid flooding process were investigated. The results showed that the initial wettability affects oil recovery performance and showed a greater effect at higher temperatures, as represented by the reservoir temperature. An extended postflush nanoflooding was performed to evaluate incremental oil recovery, and this cycle shows great potential for field applications. By evaluating the contact angle and interfacial tension, it was found that wettability alteration plays a more dominant role in the oil displacement mechanism via nano-EOR. These results...},

Extensive series of interfacial tension and adsorption measurement experiments were performed. It was observed that surfactant adsorption amount was mostly reduced when mixed with nanoparticles. Interfacial tension measurements revealed strange behavior in low and high surfactant concentrations. The optimum conditions for various scenarios of surfactant flooding were selected upon various experimental results. The flooding experiments showed that nanoparticles could efficiently improve surfactant performance by enhancing the governing mechanisms and the oil recovery was consequently increased by a considerable amount.},

abstract = {Challenges and technology gaps within the area of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) which need to be addressed in the coming research programs have been identified in the OG21 strategy document1 on "Exploration and Increased Recovery": Especially, there is a need for more cost-efficient EOR chemicals and to assure environmental acceptable chemicals and methods to avoid unwanted discharge to sea. There is therefore a clear need for increased competence on new technologies in the field of EOR. There has recently been an increasing interest in applying nanotechnology to EOR but still many topics are uncovered. Nanotechnology, which has mainly been developed in mechanical engineering, medicine and biological sciences, is expected to have a large potential for EOR applications. There is a wide range of applications of this technology, which is relevant for EOR, from employing general concepts and principles from nanotechnology, to advanced reservoir monitoring using nano-sensors and nano-analysis and to more specific technologies to overcome shortcomings in traditional EOR methods. The latter includes tailoring chemical molecules for more efficient EOR, and smart and more efficient delivery of the EOR agent. Development of efficient drug delivery in the human body is an example where such technology may be applied to improve efficiency in chemical flooding. The current work is part of the HyGreGel project, which addresses the need to develop more efficient water diversion techniques for in-depth placement of gelling chemicals. Blockage of paths that have excessive water flow can increase oil recovery and reduce unwanted water circulation in heterogeneous reservoirs. The main objective of HyGreGel is to develop a hybrid gel system based on conventional polymers and nanoparticles with functional groups as crosslinkers. The functional groups will initially be deactivated. By slow activation in the reservoir, it will be possible to place the gel constituents deep into the reservoir before gelling prohibits further flow. The present work addresses core-flooding experiments in low and high permeability sandstone cores where polymer and nanoparticles were injected separately or in mixture. The results indicate that polymer adsorption, polymer retention and IPV were generally reduced by the presence of nanoparticles. Adsorption, total retention and IPV were significantly higher in Berea compared to Bentheimer, for both polymer and nanoparticles. The adsorbed or otherwise retained polymer during injection was not released during following water floods, while the retained nanoparticles were partly released during following water floods. Nanoparticles had negligible effect on rock permeability (and thus differential pressure across the core), while polymer significantly reduced rock permeability (and increased differential pressure).},
